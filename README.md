Exercise arrays, conditionals and loops in Java.

<strong>Java programs: </strong>

Design and implement an application called Mean.java that computes and prints the mean of two lists of integers coming from the same list that has n numbers: x<sub>0</sub>, x<sub>1</sub>, …, x<sub>n-1</sub>. The first list L<sub>1</sub> contains x<sub>0</sub>, x<sub>2</sub>, …, through x<sub>n-1 </sub>if n is odd or through x<sub>n-2 </sub>if n is even. The second list L<sub>2</sub> contains x<sub>1</sub>, x<sub>3</sub>, …, through x<sub>n-1 </sub>if n is even or through x<sub>n-2 </sub>if n is odd. Ask the user to input n and read the value of n. Then ask the user to input n integers and save them in an array. Print out L<sub>1</sub> and compute the mean as a floating point value for L<sub>1</sub>. Then print out L<sub>2</sub> and compute the mean as a floating point value for L<sub>2</sub>, using the following formula:
